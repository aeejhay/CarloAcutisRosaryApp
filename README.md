**🌹 Rosary Prayer Web App **
A spiritual tool for daily devotion – built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

**✨ Project Overview**
This project is a heartfelt expression of both my faith and my skills as a software developer. Inspired by Blessed Carlo Acutis, a young saint and digital evangelizer of our generation, I wanted to create something simple, accessible, and meaningful — a digital companion for those who wish to pray the Rosary anytime, anywhere.

The Rosary Prayer Web App is a clean, lightweight web application that helps users begin their Rosary devotion with just a single click. Upon pressing the “Start Praying the Rosary” button, the app automatically detects the current day (based on your local time and timezone) and plays the correct set of mysteries for that day:

Monday & Saturday – Joyful Mysteries

Tuesday & Friday – Sorrowful Mysteries

Wednesday & Sunday – Glorious Mysteries

Thursday – Luminous Mysteries

Just hold your Rosary beads, press play, and enter into prayer and meditation.

This project is built entirely with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no frameworks or dependencies, ensuring it loads fast and works across all modern browsers. It reflects a clean design, minimal interface, and focus on user experience — making it accessible for all ages and tech levels.

**🔧 Upcoming Features**
To make the experience even richer, the app will soon include:

🔵 Bead counter animation

🌙 Light/Dark mode toggle

🎶 Ambient background music

🌐 Language switch (Tagalog or Latin)

📿 Prayer guide per decade
